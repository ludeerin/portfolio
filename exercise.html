                <h3>Soul Cycle</h3>
                <p>Soul Cycle is located at 1107 S University Ave. It is such a convenient location, and an unbeatable workout. If you are into spinning and great music, Soul Cycle would be a great workout for you! Every class is unique and incredibly motivating. It can be a bit expensive, but they have pricing deals for U-M students! </p>

                <h3>The Great Outdoors!</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite ways to get active in Ann Arbor is just running through local neighborhoods! My favorite route is as follows: You start on Hill St, in the direction toward Packard. Turn left onto Tappan Ave, then left on Oakland, right on S Forest, left on Wells Street, right on Baldwin Ave, left on Granger Ave, right on Ferndon, and continue on Ferndon until you get to E Stadium, then turn around and head back toward Hill street! It is just about 2 miles, with very few hills, and it is by far my favorite running route on campus!</p>

                <h3> The IM</h3>
                <p>My favorite U-M facility is the IM (Intramural Sports Building). It is located at 606 E Hoover Ave. The facility is very clean, and has several floors each with all of the equipment necessary for a great workout. My favorite spot is the third floor, because it is often the least crowded. I come here to run on the treadmill when it is too cold to run outside. They have awesome little mini workout studios on the sides of every floor, so you can do your floor workouts in private.</p>
